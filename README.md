# Dungeons and Dragons Spells and Monster Reference
Using a DND 5th Edition API, this site allows you to browse all of the spells and monsters in the SRD provided by Wizards of the Coast

# Live Location
The website will be up and running [here](https://bmillsmc.github.io/UI-Design-Project/lib/) once I get Github pages sorted out. For now look to the Getting Started section below to access the site on your computer.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
The list of things you need to utilize this site is pretty short on your own computer is pretty short:

- A browser
- Git on your computer
- Access to your terminal

And thats it! With these two things you can use this reference site in no time

### Installation
1. Create a new folder where you want the repository to be downloaded
2. In your terminal, use the `cd` command to change directories into the folder you just created
3. Now copy the SSH link from the green button on Github that says "Clone or Download"
4. Back in your terminal, use the command `git clone [The SSH you just copied]` to clone the repository down to your computer
5. `cd` into the `lib/` folder
6. If you haven't ever used an http-server do the command `npm install http-server -g` to install the server globally
7. Run the server with the command `http-server` and open localhost on whatever port its using (on my laptop it uses :8080)
8. You should be up and running

## Usage
This site can be used in tandem with any DND DM writing session, game session, or just to sait your appetite for DND knowledge on the go.

## Suggestions
I'm always looking to learn and grow as a developer. I'm not afraid of critisism, so please don't be afraid to give me suggestions for the site to make it better. Also please always point out bugs so that I can fix them.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Notes
The Monsters tab is not currently populated with information yet. The method to do this will be updated shortly.
